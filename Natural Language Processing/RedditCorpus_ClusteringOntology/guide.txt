Reduced Matrix:

0. Use T-SNE for dimensionality reduction
1. K-means clustering. Visualize results with legend.
2. Prepare summary list of documents. how do the clusters match with original document categories (subs)?
3. Hierarchical clustering
4. Visualize the clusters with legend 
5. Describe results. How do the clusters match with original document categories?
6. Compare K-means and Heirarchical clustering. Which do I prefer to present to management? What do they tell us about the corpus? Which provides the most clear-cut results?

7. Develop topic modeling solution using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
8. Identify documents with topics and describe topics with terms
9. Use topic modeling result to provide a corpus description for management

10. bi-clustering on full documents-by-terms matrix. Use SKlearn Spectral biclustering.
11. Describe results. Compare to cluster analysis and topic modeling.

12. Construct an ontology that is broader enough to provide a framework.
13. Provide ontology visualization
14. Review methods and their usefulness in gaining a corpus understanding
